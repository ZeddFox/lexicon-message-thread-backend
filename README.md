1. Purpose
A console app for create, read, update and delete functionality.

2. Assignment
This is a mandatory assignment. Finish it by Friday latest. Share your code
to GitHub and send the URL to me in chat. Do it by Friday lunch the latest.
When your code is run, the user should be able to manage a collection of
different concert venues that form part of a ticket system. The user, which
would be a person in the ticket marketing organization, should be able to
enter a new concert, get a list of all concerts, edit a value for an individual
concert and delete a concert.

Model the concert class to your own judgement. A concert takes place
somewhere, has some performer, at sometime, maybe with a capacity for
an amount of people. Each concert object should have a unique id.
Outside of having a concert class, itâ€™s up to you how you choose to set up
the app.

During the week, a number of subjects will be brought up that have
relevance for the assignment:
- The List collection
- Reading and writing to file
- Convert text into number
  
A challenge with the assignment is how to organize the user interface. You
can choose to have a menu with all the options written out or have a
minimal interface similar to what you work with in the command prompt
on the PC.
